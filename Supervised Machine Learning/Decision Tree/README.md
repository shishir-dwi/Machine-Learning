# Decision Tree
A decision tree is a type of machine learning algorithm used for supervised learning tasks, such as classification and regression. 
It is a tree-like model in which each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node represents a class label or a numerical value.

The decision tree algorithm works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of the features, 
with the goal of minimizing some measure of impurity, such as the Gini impurity or entropy. 
At each internal node, the algorithm selects the feature that best separates the data into the purest subsets, and creates a branch for each possible value of the feature. 
This process continues until all the data is classified or a stopping criterion is met.
