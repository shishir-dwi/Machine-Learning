# Regression

Regression is a way to understand the relationship between an independent variable or feature and a dependent variable or outcome. 
You can then evaluate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables and predict the outcome. 
Regression is a field of statistical study that forms a core part of predictive models in machine learning.
Regression problems occur when the output variable is a real or continuous value such as "salary" or "weight".

## Types-of-Regression
<ul>

  <li><b>Simple-Linear-Regression:</b> Simple linear regression is a linear regression technique that draws a straight line through data points to minimize the error between the line and the data points. 
  One of the simplest and most basic types of machine learning regression. 
  In this case, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear. That is, there is only one independent variable.</li>
  
  <li><b>Multiple-Linear-Regression:</b> Multiple linear regression is a technique used when more than one independent variable is used.
  This is a type of multiple linear regression used when there is more than one independent variable.
  It is better suited than simple linear regression when multiple explanatory variables are involved.</li>
  
  <li><b>Logistic-Regression:</b> Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable can take on one of two values, such as true or false, success or failure. 
  Logistic regression models can be used to predict the likelihood of a dependent variable occurring. 
  In general, output values should be binary. 
  Sigmoid curves can be used to show the relationship between dependent and independent variables.</li>
